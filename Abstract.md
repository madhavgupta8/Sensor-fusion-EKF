# Abstract

The aim of this project is track the forward most point of a car entering a parking
spot. This system can be especially applied in formula racing pit box. The motion
of the vehicle is non linear, therefore the Extended Kalman Filter has been used to
estimate the states of the vehicle. Hypothesis Testing has also been used to determine
if the vehicle is on the centre line. Two pinhole pan tilt cameras are placed at either
side of the parking space at the same x and y coordinate.
